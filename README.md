# 2pac-tribute-page

A simple but beautiful design. Click [here](https://d0bledore.github.io/2pac-tribute-page/) to see my design. 

## Features

- **bg-image**
Upon first visiting the landing page, the user is met with a high resolution image of Tupac Shakur that covers the entire screen. 
Naturally, the user would want to scroll down to see if there is more. 
 
- **js-toggle-script**
A simple `js` script which triggers on scroll. The scroll event triggers the header to go from 0 opacity to 100 opacity in 0.3s. 
This gives the user a feeling of 'having arrived' at the site and being 'greeted' by the site.

- **the header**
In this version the header gives a simple logo on the left spelling '2PAC' in capital letters.
In the middle is the title of the page, which in this case needs little to no explanation but hopefully a future version of this site will eloborate more on that.
On the right are 3 navigation options, in a format suitable for mobile phone users.

## About page

The about page is a special feature, in a sense. It can be on the same page, it can be on a different site. It is information to the user given by the site-developer. 
The web developer, *for this tribute page*, wants to establish something about the person he gives tribute to: 
The importance of his figure, the longevity of his era, his enemy and his supporters.

Whom do I write this to? 
Not to the dead man.. but to his supporters.

About, music and Legacy
